#Header: Introduction to Immediate Loading Implant Dentistry
#Content: Immediate loading implant dentistry involves the placement of a dental implant and its subsequent loading with a prosthesis immediately after surgery. This approach has gained popularity due to its potential to decrease treatment time, improve aesthetics, and increase patient satisfaction. However, the success of immediate loading depends on various factors including the quality and quantity of the patient's bone, the surgical technique used, and the design of the implant and prosthesis. This presentation will discuss recent research findings on immediate loading implant dentistry, focusing on various aspects such as long-term outcomes, peri-implant tissue alteration, and surgical protocols.

#Header: Long-term Outcomes with Zygomatic Implants
#Content: A systematic review and meta-analysis by Brennand Roper M et al., (2023) reported long-term survival rates of zygomatic implants (ZI). The study found that the mean survival of ZIs was 96.2% at 6 years. Furthermore, immediate loading showed a statistically significant increase in survival over delayed loading. However, sinusitis was the most frequently encountered biological complication. It is important to note that the study included only studies that met specific inclusion criteria, potentially limiting the generalizability of the findings.

#Header: Peri-implant Hard and Soft Tissue Alteration
#Content: A 2-year prospective observational study by Yamada S et al., (2023) evaluated how peri-implant hard and soft tissue height alter after final prostheses placement. The study found that significantly less hard and soft tissue resorption occurs around implants with thick peri-implant soft tissue. These findings suggest the importance of considering the thickness of peri-implant soft tissue in planning for implant placement. However, the study was limited to a 2-year follow-up period, and longer-term outcomes remain unclear.

#Header: Strategic Implants and Bone Morphogenic Changes
#Content: A case series by Gangadhar B et al., (2023) evaluated the efficacy of strategic implants regarding primary stability, quality of bone, survival, and clinical success in the long-term. The study found that strategic implants, based on immediate loading, showed promising results in terms of stability and survival. However, as a case series, the study lacks a control group, and the findings may not be applicable to all patient populations.

#Header: Guided Zygomatic Implantology for Oral Cancer Rehabilitation
#Content: A case report by Grecchi F et al., (2023) presented the rehabilitation of a patient with oral cancer using zygomatic implant placement and an immediate fixed provisional prosthesis made with computer-aided technologies. The patient reported good function, aesthetics, and significant enhancement in quality of life at the 2-year follow-up. This case report suggests that guided zygomatic implantology can be a promising alternative for oral cancer patients with large defects. However, further research with larger sample sizes is needed to confirm these findings.

#Header: Graftless Immediate Dual Implant Anatomic Placement
#Content: A clinical report by Ramakrishnan H et al., (2023) described the extraction of an infected mandibular right first molar, followed by immediate dual placement of dental implants in the sockets. This atraumatic graft-free operating technique and immediate placement resulted in the preservation of hard and soft tissues. It also increased the patient's comfort, acceptance, and satisfaction due to immediate loading with a provisional removable prosthesis. This report underlines the potential advantages of immediate dual implant placement, but more research is needed to validate these results.

#Header: Impact of Different Surgical Drilling Protocols
#Content: A study by Elsheikh HA et al., (2022) compared three different drilling techniques for implant site preparation to enhance the primary stability of the early loaded single implant in the posterior maxilla. The study found that preparing the implant bed using the undersized drilling technique provides high implant primary stability without the need for additional instruments or cost. These findings highlight the importance of the surgical drilling protocol in achieving implant stability, but further research is needed to confirm these results.

#Header: Comparing Immediate Implant Placement with Early Implant Placement
#Content: A systematic review and meta-analysis by Asghar AM et al., (2023) compared the clinical efficacy of the immediate implant placement (IIP) protocol in the aesthetic zone with early dental implant placement (EIP) protocol. The study found that the aesthetics and clinical results of IIP are comparable to EIP. However, the pink aesthetic score (PES) was improved in EIP as compared to IIP. These findings suggest that both IIP and EIP can be effective, but the choice between the two may depend on aesthetic considerations.

#Header: Evaluation of Strain and Insertion Torque of Mini-implants
#Content: A study by Xavier J et al., (2023) used finite element analysis to assess the strain and insertion torque of mini-implants on a bone model at two distinct angulations of 45° and 90°. The study found that for maximum stability, single-threaded mini-implant with perpendicular insertion angle is preferred. These findings underline the importance of the insertion angle in achieving implant stability, but further research is needed to validate these results.

#Headers: Summary and Conclusion
#Content: Immediate loading implant dentistry has shown promising results in terms of implant survival and success, peri-implant tissue alteration, and patient satisfaction. Factors such as the thickness of peri-implant soft tissue, the surgical drilling protocol, and the insertion angle of the implant can influence these outcomes. However, more research is needed to further validate these findings and to develop guidelines for optimal implant placement and loading protocols.
