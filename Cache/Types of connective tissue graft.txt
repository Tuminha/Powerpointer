#Header: Free Gingival Graft (FGG)
#Content: Involves taking tissue from the palate and grafting it to an area of gum tissue that needs augmentation.

#Slide: 3
#Header: Subepithelial Connective Tissue Graft (SCTG)
#Content: Tissue is harvested from beneath the surface of the palate and grafted onto the area of gum recession.

#Slide: 4
#Header: Acellular Dermal Matrix Graft (ADMG)
#Content: Involves the use of a processed tissue matrix derived from human or animal sources. It acts as a scaffold for the patient's own cells to grow into.

#Slide: 5
#Header: Pedicle Graft
#Content: Uses nearby gum tissue that is partially cut and rotated over the area in need of gum tissue augmentation.

#Slide: 6
#Header: Allograft and Xenograft
#Content: Graft materials derived from human or animal sources, respectively. Used as alternatives to using the patient's own tissue for grafting.

#Slide: 7
#Header: Factors to Consider
#Content: The choice of graft type depends on factors such as the patient's oral health status, extent of tissue loss, and treatment goals discussed with the dentist or periodontist.

#Header: Summary
#Content: There are several types of connective tissue grafts used in dentistry, including Free Gingival Graft, Subepithelial Connective Tissue Graft, Acellular Dermal Matrix Graft, Pedicle Graft, and Allograft/Xenograft. The choice of graft type depends on various factors and should be discussed with a dental professional.
