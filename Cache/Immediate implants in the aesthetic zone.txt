#Header: Introduction to Immediate Implants in the Aesthetic Zone
#Content: Immediate implant placement in the aesthetic zone is a well-documented and increasingly popular treatment modality. It involves the placement of dental implants into extraction sockets immediately after tooth extraction. This approach offers several potential advantages, including reduced treatment time, fewer surgical interventions, and potentially better aesthetic outcomes. However, it requires careful patient selection, precise surgical technique, and meticulous postoperative care to achieve optimal results.

#Header: Immediate Implant Placement with and without Provisionalization
#Content: A study by Fu PS et al. (2023) compared immediate implant placement with and without immediate provisionalization. The study found no significant differences in primary implant stability and marginal bone loss between the two groups. However, patient satisfaction was significantly higher in the group with immediate provisionalization. This suggests that immediate provisionalization may enhance patient satisfaction without compromising implant stability or bone health. However, the study's findings may be influenced by potential biases, such as the non-blinding of patients and clinicians.

#Header: Acrylic Tooth Splint: An Immediate Provisionalization Technique
#Content: Adam FA et al. (2023) described a simple and cost-effective technique for immediate provisionalization following tooth extraction. The technique involves the use of an acrylic tooth splint, which can temporarily replace an extracted tooth while waiting for soft and hard tissue healing. This approach can enhance patient satisfaction and compliance before definitive implant restoration. However, the authors noted that each provisionalization method has its advantages and disadvantages, and the choice of technique should consider various factors such as material availability, ease of fabrication, costs, and the potential impact on the future implant site.

#Header: Immediate Implant Placement Using a Novel Tapered Implant Design
#Content: Pariente L et al. (2023) assessed the use of a novel self-cutting, tapered implant in combination with a digital integrated prosthetic workflow for immediate implant placement and restoration. The study found that this approach resulted in predictable functional and aesthetic results. The implant survival rate was 100% at the 1-year recall after loading. However, this study was a case series with a small sample size, which may limit the generalizability of the findings.

#Header: The "Tunneled Sandwich" Technique 
#Content: Bilhan H et al. (2023) introduced the "tunneled sandwich" technique, which combines immediate implant placement with the enhancement of the buccal tissue. This technique was found to help preserve the buccal volume, contributing to favorable long-term results both biologically and esthetically. However, this was a retrospective report of 10 cases, and further research is needed to confirm these findings.

#Header: Hard and Soft Tissue Alterations After Immediate Implant Placement
#Content: Yuan DX et al. (2023) evaluated the hard and soft tissue alterations following immediate implant placement with customized definitive abutments in the esthetic zone. The study found that the use of definitive abutments with immediate implant placement could potentially maintain the buccal bone thickness and height, as well as the midfacial gingival margin position and papilla height. However, the study was a retrospective analysis, which may be subject to selection bias and confounding factors.

#Header: Immediate Implant Placement With or Without Immediate Provisionalization
#Content: Qin R et al. (2023) conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to determine whether immediate implant placement and loading renders different outcomes from delayed loading. The study found that immediate implant placement and loading resulted in lower midfacial mucosa level change compared to delayed loading. This suggests that immediate implant placement and loading may be beneficial for preserving the physiological soft and hard tissue architecture in the anterior zone. However, the included studies varied in terms of follow-up duration, which may influence the results.

#Header: Immediate Implant Placement in Intact Fresh Extraction Sockets
#Content: Elaskary A et al. (2023) conducted a randomized clinical trial to assess esthetic and soft and hard tissue outcomes following immediate implant placement using vestibular socket therapy versus partial extraction therapy. Both methods preserved alveolar bone structure and peri-implant tissues following immediate implants. However, the study's findings may be influenced by potential biases, such as the non-blinding of patients and clinicians.

#Header: Comparing Clinical Outcomes of Immediate Implant Placement with Early Implant Placement
#Content: Asghar AM et al. (2023) conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the clinical efficacy of the immediate implant placement protocol in the aesthetic zone compared to early dental implant placement protocol. The study found that the aesthetics and clinical results of immediate implant placement protocol are comparable to early and delayed placement protocols. However, the study's findings may be influenced by potential biases, such as the non-blinding of patients and clinicians.

#Header: Management of Root Sensitivity Following Socket Shield Technique
#Content: Fang Q et al. (2023) presented a unique complication after a socket shield procedure and a novel management of the complication. The socket shield technique has been advocated as a means to maintain the facial and/or interproximal osseous and gingival architecture. However, it is a technique-sensitive procedure and various complications related to it have been reported. Further research is needed to validate the findings of this study.

#Header: Frequency of Screw-Retained Angulated Screw Channel Single Crown Following Immediate Implant Placement
#Content: Kan JYK et al. (2023) conducted a cone beam computed tomography study to determine the frequency of screw-retained crown using angulated screw channel abutment for single immediate implant placement and provisionalization in the esthetic zone. The study found that 90% of single immediate implant placement in the esthetic zone can be restored with screw-retained crown when utilizing angulated screw channel. This suggests that the use of angulated screw channel abutment can significantly increase the possibility of using a screw-retained restoration following immediate implant placement.

#Headers: Summary and Conclusion
#Content: Immediate implant placement in the aesthetic zone is an effective and increasingly popular treatment approach. Various techniques and methods, such as immediate provisionalization, the use of novel tapered implant designs, and the "tunneled sandwich" technique, can enhance the outcomes of this procedure. However, careful patient selection, precise surgical technique, and meticulous postoperative care are crucial for achieving optimal results. Future research with long-term follow-up is warranted to further validate these findings and explore new techniques and approaches.
