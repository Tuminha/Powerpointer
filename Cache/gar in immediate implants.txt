#Header: Introduction to Immediate Implants and Grafting
#Content: Immediate implants are dental implants that are placed immediately after tooth extraction. This procedure eliminates the need for a second surgery to place the implant and reduces the overall treatment time. Grafting is a procedure that involves adding bone or bone-like material to the jaw to support the implant. This presentation provides an overview of the role and importance of grafting in immediate implants.
