#Header: What is the Socket Shield Technique?
#Content: The Socket Shield Technique involves retaining the buccal portion of the natural tooth root during extraction, leaving it in place to act as a shield for the surrounding bone and soft tissue. This technique allows for the preservation of the facial bone and gingival architecture.

#Header: Benefits of the Socket Shield Technique
#Content: The Socket Shield Technique offers several advantages, including:
- Preservation of the facial bone and soft tissue
- Maintenance of the natural emergence profile
- Enhanced esthetic outcomes
- Improved long-term stability of the implant

#Header: Procedure of the Socket Shield Technique
#Content: The Socket Shield Technique involves the following steps:
1. Extraction of the tooth while retaining the buccal root fragment.
2. Preparation of the implant site and placement of the implant.
3. Creation of a socket shield by sectioning the retained root fragment.
4. Placement of a temporary restoration to support the soft tissue during healing.
5. Final restoration with a custom abutment and crown.
